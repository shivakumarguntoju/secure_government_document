## ‚ùì Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q: How secure is Aadhaar data?
**A**: "Aadhaar numbers are validated client-side using Verhoeff algorithm, masked in UI showing only last 4 digits, stored with strict Firebase Security Rules, and never exposed in logs or analytics."

### Q: What about GDPR compliance?
**A**: "Firebase infrastructure is GDPR-compliant. We implement data isolation, users can delete their data, activity logging provides audit trails, and no third-party data sharing."

### Q: Can it handle many users?
**A**: "Yes. Firebase automatically scales. We've implemented lazy loading, code splitting, and efficient queries. Can handle thousands of concurrent users."

### Q: What's the cost?
**A**: "Firebase free tier covers initial users. For production with moderate usage (100-500 users), estimated $10-50/month. Scales with usage."

### Q: Why Firebase instead of traditional server?
**A**: "Serverless architecture: no server management, automatic scaling, built-in security, real-time sync, 99.95% uptime SLA, and cost-effective for startups."

### Q: How do you prevent file upload abuse?
**A**: "Multiple layers: file type whitelist (PDF, DOC, Images only), 5MB size limit, Firebase Security Rules, authentication required, and activity logging."

### Q: What happens if Firebase goes down?
**A**: "Firebase has 99.95% uptime SLA. We implement error handling, offline support, and retry logic. Users see friendly error messages."

### Q: Can users export their data?
**A**: "Currently users can download individual documents. Future enhancement: bulk export all documents as ZIP file."

### Q: How is sharing controlled?
**A**: "Granular permissions: owner sets view-only or download access. Recipients identified by email or Aadhaar. Access can be revoked anytime."

### Q: What about mobile users?
**A**: "Fully responsive design works on all devices. Future roadmap includes native React Native mobile app."
