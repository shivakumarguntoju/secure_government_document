## ‚ùì Common Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why Firebase instead of traditional backend?**
A: Firebase provides serverless architecture, real-time sync, built-in security rules, and automatic scaling without infrastructure management.

**Q: How is Aadhaar data secured?**
A: Aadhaar numbers are validated with Verhoeff algorithm, masked in UI (showing only last 4 digits), and stored with restricted access in Firestore with security rules.

**Q: What about data privacy regulations?**
A: The system implements data isolation (per-user data access), activity logging for audit trails, and follows Firebase's GDPR-compliant infrastructure.

**Q: Can this scale to thousands of users?**
A: Yes, Firebase Firestore and Storage automatically scale. The architecture supports lazy loading, code splitting, and efficient queries.

### Business Questions

**Q: What is the deployment cost?**
A: Firebase offers a generous free tier. For production, costs depend on storage (Firestore + Cloud Storage) and bandwidth usage. Estimated $10-50/month for moderate usage.

**Q: How long did development take?**
A: Core features took approximately 2-3 weeks for a single developer. Additional polish and security hardening added another week.

**Q: What's the maintenance effort?**
A: Low - serverless architecture means no server management. Focus is on feature updates and security monitoring.

**Q: Can we add more document types?**
A: Yes, easily extensible. Just update the constants and UI dropdowns. No backend changes needed.
